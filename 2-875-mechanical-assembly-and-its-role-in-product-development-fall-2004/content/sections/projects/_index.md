Guidelines for the term project are as follows:

*   Buy a small assembled product costing no more than ~$35 and having 10 to 20 parts
    *   Be sure you can take it apart and put it back together
    *   Save the packaging and instructions
    *   SDM students can use a product from work
*   You will analyze it in detail technically and economically and design an assembly line
*   Lecture 3 hand in a description of what you bought and names/e-mails of team members
*   Examples: hand-held power tools, small clocks and timers, Luxo lamps, small home appliances, toys
*   Schedule a time to show it to me for an hour ASAP
*   Hand in Request for Payment to get reimbursed

Project Deliverables
--------------------

The project is completed in six incremental steps. Each step culminates in a report that must be handed in at the assigned lecture session.

Report 1: Completely describe the product

Report 2: Datum Flow Chain (DFC) analysis of the product

Report 3: Choreograph each assembly step and Design for Assembly (DFA)

Report 4: Create a floor layout

Report 5: Design a workstation

Report 6: Economic analysis and discrete event simulation of your system
